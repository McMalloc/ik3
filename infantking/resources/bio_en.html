As an acoustic duo, Nina Przyborowski and Stephan Dillenberger had already gained considerable musical experience, when they decided in early 2012 -tired from their often difficult and thankless experience as Songwriters- to recruit two new band members in order to risk a fresh musical start.

Through mutual friends and a hint of luck bass player Robert “Willi” Wlček was recruited as fulltime member. Since the departure of the band’s first drummer Seppo Uhari in the summer of 2013, Tim Flügge occupies the seat behind the drums.

Infant King that began in early 2012 as an unambitious project in a dirty basement (until early 2015 the band performed under the name Pussy con Carne) has matured to a band that does no longer hesitate to pinpoint the role expectations and customary lies of our day-to-day lives in unmerciful lyrics. In their songs whose most important purpose probably is to function as an act of musical self-therapy the band combines straightforward Garage Rock with the troubled soul of the Delta Blues, without trying to deny common role models like The Dead Weather or Nico Vega.

Proof of their energetic live presence was given by qualifying for the finals of one of Germany’s most established band contests, SWM-Musicids Magdeburg, early in 2012. It was their first live show together and already determined that the band would not just give in to become yet another short lived local party band.
Later on in the summer the band already performed their first unplugged radio shows on Radio Rockland and Radio Fritz/RBB. In March 2013, their first EP “Peace and Love ‘n’ Shit” was realised in the studios “andereBaustelle Berlin” and “Heartdisco-Studio Magdeburg”.

Triggered by their EP release in May 2013, the band significantly increased their media exposure. Countless favorable reviews and considerable radio play on MDR Sputnik or Detektor FM laid the foundation for their first TV appearance in a detailed band portrait on German TV channel MDR. Another definite high point was reached in August 2013 when the four musicians performed as a support band for Top10-act Frida Gold in front of an electrifying crowd of more than ten thousand people. Many shows all over Germany followed, regularly supporting notable acts such as Swedish electro-rockers MF/MB/, German electro-punk band Captain Capa or Hamburg’s no-longer-insiders’-tip Trümmer. In 2014, during their first international tour, the band added live shows in Riga (LV), Brno (CZ) or Vienna (AT) to their respectable gig list.

In 2015, alongside a continuously large number of concerts at home and abroad (with acts like Royal Republic or The Feud) Infant King released the music video of their single “Sweet Revenge”. Following one year of excessive preparation and production, their first album “Superschizophrenic” was published in June 2015.
